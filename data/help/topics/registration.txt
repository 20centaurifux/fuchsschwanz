REGISTRATION
     Your nick is how people know you. If you want to use a nick permanently
     you should register it with the /p command.

     A new record is created if you register a nickname for the very first
     time. From now on your password is required for registration.  Change
     your password with /cp.

     A registered nick has an inbox for private messages. This allows you
     to send messages to signed off users.

     You can view user profiles with /whois. Feel free to fill in your own
     profile to share personal information with other users.
